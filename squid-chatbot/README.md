# Squid Cloud code samples

This repo contains official samples that showcase features of [Squid Cloud](https://squid.cloud).
- Created a basic chatbot functionality using Squid Cloud.
- We have options to use any llm of our choice like GPT-3.5/Gemini.
- Connected our response mechanism with Squid storage and S3 bucket.
- We can also get accurate responses by passing context as raw text/URL/pdf in our squid chatbot. 
- Deployed the code on Squid.cloud.
  
Problems that can be addressed-
-Can include the option to use multiple files to pass into the context instead of a single file
-Can include more options for integrating various other databases/cloud storages and pre-trained llm models.
