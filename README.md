each example demonstrates a different aspect of squid.cloud offering 


Queries/Challenges:
- How we can manage relations in the collection on high-level abstractions. (I can achieve this functionality with the help of stored procedure but I want to achieve it on an abstraction level only like we use in Entity Framework or other ORM frameworks)
- Is the backend always required, can we write web applications without requiring a backend? simply by connecting to the database using squid SDK? We have to add secure attributes, and define all API end points, can we bypass the same?
